# arcgis-js-TOC
Table of Contents widget for the ArcGIS JavaScript API

One stand alone widget that nicely combines tons of Table of Contents functions for your ArcGIS JavaScript API web app:
- basemap gallery: choose between two basemaps.
- fade slider: controls imagery opacity over the basemaps.
- layer list: checkboxes to control visibility of individual layers, or toggle all layers on/off. checkboxes become disabled with scale dependant visibility.
- tabbed TOC: option to include tabs to separate your layers into categories within the TOC.
- legend: expand / collapse each individual layer's symbology (similar to ArcGIS for Desktop's TOC), or expand/collapse all.
- layer info button/window: a modal window that provides symbology, source/copywrite information of the layer, and the layer's description from the REST endpoint.

working sample and example code coming soon!
